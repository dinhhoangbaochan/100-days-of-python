# Python 100 Days - Day 1

## What have I learned in Day 1?

### Variable
To assign a variable in Python, you could just simple follow this syntax:
```Python
variable_name = value
```

### Concatenate
It's simply, use `plus` sign (+).

### `input()` function
It's a function to use in order to get input from the keyboard.

### `len()` function
It's a function to get the length - the amount of characters - of whatever passed in the argument.

### The project
Ask users 2 things: what is the city name that they used to live and what is their pet's name. Concatenate those 2 values to create a band name for users.
Remember: When asking users to input, you should drop a new line so they can input their answer.
